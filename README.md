# Marketplace Seller Performance Analysis

**Improving Marketplace Performance Through Seller, Delivery, and Customer Behavior Analytics**

An end-to-end data analytics project (SQL → Python → Power BI) built on the Olist
Brazilian E-Commerce public dataset, analyzing seller performance, delivery
reliability, customer satisfaction, and regional trends to identify concrete,
actionable business recommendations.

## Data Source

This project uses the [Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
(Kaggle) — 9 relational tables covering ~100,000 real orders (2016-2018).

Raw CSVs are not committed to this repo (kept out via `.gitignore` to keep the
repo lightweight). To reproduce:
1. Download the dataset from the Kaggle link above
2. Place all 9 CSVs into `Dataset/`
3. Run `Python/load_to_db.ipynb` to build the local SQLite database
4. Run `Python/eda.ipynb` to reproduce the full analysis

## Key Findings

**Note on currency**: all monetary figures are in Brazilian Real (R$), the native
currency of the dataset.

**Seller Performance**
- Top seller generated ~R$229K in revenue across 1,132 orders; strategies vary — some
  sellers drive revenue through volume, others through higher-ticket items with fewer orders.
- One seller showed a **92% late-delivery rate** across 25 real orders — a genuine
  outlier flagged for audit.
- Seller order volume and late-delivery rate are essentially uncorrelated (r = 0.01) —
  delivery risk is spread across sellers of all sizes, not concentrated among small sellers.

**Customer Experience**
- Average review score drops sharply with delivery delay: **4.21 (on-time) → 2.68
  (1-7 days late) → 1.70 (8+ days late)**, confirmed by a -0.23 correlation between
  delay and review score.
- The lowest-rated categories (`security_and_services`: 2.50 avg review,
  `diapers_and_hygiene`: 3.38) are not driven by delay — both are delivered **early**
  on average (-17.0 and -11.4 days respectively, vs. a -12.1 day dataset average),
  yet still score poorly. This rules out logistics as the cause and points to
  product/category-specific factors instead.

**Revenue & Cost**
- `christmas_supplies` and `signaling_and_security` carry the highest freight cost
  relative to revenue (~30-37%), an efficiency concern beyond just raw margin.
- Credit card is the dominant payment method (73.8%), followed by boleto (19.4%),
  a Brazil-specific bank-slip payment method.
- Average order value rises steadily with installment count (R$91 at 1 installment
  to R$292 at 10), reflecting natural behavior of splitting larger purchases.

**Regional**
- São Paulo (SP) generates ~R$5.2M in revenue — over 3x the next-highest state
  (Rio de Janeiro, ~R$1.8M).
- Northeast states (AL, MA, SE, CE, PI) show the worst late-delivery rates
  (15-22%), likely reflecting distance from the São Paulo-centered seller base.
  Notably, Rio de Janeiro — a top-2 revenue state — also shows an above-average
  late rate (13.3%), a flag worth addressing given its revenue importance.

Full methodology, data cleaning decisions, and all 9 research questions are
documented in `Python/eda.ipynb` and `SQL/data_cleaning.sql`.

## Data Cleaning Highlights

- Caught and fixed a join bug where duplicate review rows (547 orders had 2-3
  reviews each) were inflating the master table by ~0.6% — resolved using
  `ROW_NUMBER()` to keep only the most recent review per order.
- Identified that ~3% of orders never completed their lifecycle (canceled/
  unavailable), and excluded them from delivery-time calculations accordingly.
